### Author: Yibin Wang, Yinlong Dai, Hengkai Pan
Since file size of 95-Cloud dataset is too large, please download dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sorour/95cloud-cloud-segmentation-on-satellite-images) then create a folder named 95-Cloud in the root dictionary of repo and place all the files in the folder named 95-Cloud. After that, you could run python or juputer notebook file to train and save your models based on your need. 

You could also load some pretrained model from folder named models.
